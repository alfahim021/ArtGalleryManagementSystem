- Manage art galleries and their exhibitions.
- Track artworks, artists, and auction information.
- Handle visitor records, tickets, and guides.
- Maintain seller and ticket sales information.
- Supports data integrity with normalized database design.

## Database Design
- Relational database schema with tables for each entity.
- Use of sequences for auto-incrementing primary keys.
- Normalized to 3NF to reduce data redundancy.
- Includes views and sample queries for data retrieval.

---

## Files Included
- `create_tables.sql` — SQL scripts to create tables and sequences.
- `insert_data.sql` — SQL scripts to insert sample data.
- `queries.sql` — Sample queries and views.
- `diagrams/ER_Diagram.png` — Entity Relationship Diagram (add your diagram here).
- `Requirements.txt` — Project requirements document.
- `Database Project.docx` — Full project documentation (optional).

---

## Technologies Used
- Oracle SQL (or any compatible RDBMS)
- SQL for database schema and data manipulation

---

## How to Use
1. Run the `create_tables.sql` script to create the database schema and sequences.
2. Run the `insert_data.sql` script to populate tables with sample data.
3. Use the `queries.sql` script for sample queries and views to explore the database.
4. Use any SQL client or IDE compatible with your RDBMS to run the scripts.
5. Refer to the ER diagram for database structure visualization.

## Future Improvements
- Develop a user-friendly front-end interface for gallery staff.
- Implement advanced reporting and analytics.
- Add user authentication and role-based access control.
- Include backup and restore functionalities.
